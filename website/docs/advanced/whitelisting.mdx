# Whitelisting vs Blacklisting

> ❗️ Whitelisting/Blacklisting is no longer available in versions after `3.x.x`, and has been replaced with `fallbackRule`.

Shield allows you to lock-in your schema. This way, you can seamlessly develop and publish your work without worrying about exposing your data. To lock in your service simply set `fallbackRule` to `deny` like this;

```ts
const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    users: [User!]!
    newFeatures: FeaturesConnection!
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    author: Author!
  }

  type Author {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    secret: String
  }
`

const permissions = shield(
  {
    Query: {
      users: allow,
    },
    User: allow,
    Author: {
      id: allow,
      name: allow,
    },
  },
  { fallbackRule: deny },
)
```

You can achieve same functionality by setting every "rule-undefined" field to `deny` the request.
