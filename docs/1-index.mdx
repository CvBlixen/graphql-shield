# Shield :shield:

GraphQL permissions done right!

## What is Shield?

Shield is a GraphQL library that helps you create a permission layer for your server.
Its main focus is creating a meaningful, well-rounded and scalable API that will make you
confident about your permission layer.

Using an intuitive rule-first API, you'll be able to define the collection of rules
that you can use across your permission system.

## Features

- :scissors: **Flexible:** Based on [GraphQL Middleware](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-middleware).
- :relieved: **Easy to use:** Just add permissions to your [Yoga](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-yoga) `middlewares` set, and you are ready to go!
- :handshake: **Compatible:** Works with all GraphQL Servers.
- :rocket: **Smart:** Intelligent V8 Shield engine caches all your request to prevent any unnecessary load.
- :dart: **Per-Type or Per-Field:** Write permissions for your schema, types or specific fields.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add graphql-shield
